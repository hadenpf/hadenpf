I'm a (primarily front-end) developer, currently working for [Notify] and helping to maintain [Pulse Framework][pulse], and
incredibly in love with TypeScript and [`yarn`][yarn].

In my free time, I work on some side projects, such as:

- [Octobanzo], a Discord bot
- [Rocker], a music streaming service
- [BuildMode], a Minecraft server plugin
- a Cloudflare [redirect worker][redirect-worker] for redirect-based domains (like [pulsejs.dev][pulse]!)
