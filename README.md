I'm a (primarily front-end) developer, currently working for [Notify](https://notify.me) and helping to maintain [Pulse Framework](https://pulsejs.dev), and
incredibly in love with TypeScript and `yarn`.

In my free time, I work on some side projects, such as:
- [Octobanzo](https://github.com/octobanzo/octobanzo), a Discord bot
- [Rocker](https://github.com/rockerapp), a music streaming service
- [BuildMode](https://github.com/hadenpf/BuildMode), a Minecraft server plugin
- and some others
