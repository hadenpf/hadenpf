### About me

I yell at people to migrate to `yarn` and TypeScript.

### Projects

I like to spend a decent amount of my free time working on side projects. Here are a few things I've made:

- [BuildMode], a Minecraft server plugin
- [Spleef], a custom version of the popular Minecraft minigame
- a Cloudflare [redirect worker][redirect-worker] for redirect-based domains (like [pulsejs.dev][pulse]!)
- [Octobanzo], a general-purpose Discord bot
- [Rocker], a music streaming service
